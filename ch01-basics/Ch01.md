# Basics

``` 
var name: String;

var a: Int, b: String;

var c, d : Int

name = "Ab"
a = 5;
b = "ABH"
c = 6;
d = 7;

print(name, a, b, c, d)
```
> **Typesafety is strictly followed by swift**

```
let con = 100;
```
> con is constant now and cannot be assigned a new value here*


## printing

```
print("Hello")
print("There")

print("Hello"); print("There")
```

#### to print them in same line, we can 

```
print("hello", terminator: " ")
print("There")
```
> by default, terminator is a new line character

## values in string (interpolation)

```
let fruits = 100
print("I have \(fruits) fruits")
```

## Semicolons

> **semicolons are only manadatory when it has to separate two statements in the same line, otherwise it is optional

```
print("helo") // is okay
print("Hello"); // is also okay
print("Hello"); print("there") // manadatory
```

------------------

# Data Types
  
> **Int** is the type if we need to assign it to any variable

> swift provides 8, 16, 32, 64 bit formats 


## Integer bounds

> 8 bit is represented as UInt8, 32 bit as Int32

```
print(UInt8.min, UInt8.max)
// 0 255


print(Int32.min, Int32.max)

// -2147483648 2147483647
```


#### by default swift provides Int as Int32 on 32-bit platform and on 64-bit platform it provides Int64 by default


## UInt - Unsigned integers

```
print(UInt32.min, UInt32.max)
// 0 4294967295

```

> unsigned numbers start from 0
> on 32 bit platform, UInt is same as UInt32
> on 64 bit platform, UInt is same as UInt64

```
print(UInt.max)
print(UInt64.max)
```


## Floating Point and Double

> **Double:** represent a 64-bit floating number
> **Float:** represents a 32-bit floating number
> **Double** has precision of at least 15 decimal digits
> **Float** has of 6 decimal digits

> **when both types are appropriate, there double is preferred**

```
var flotOrDoub = 42.0;
```
> **if we don't specify the type of float or double then by default swift assumes it is double **

```
var combinedFloatInt = 3 + 0.14
```
> **automatically the type of combinedFloatInt is inferred as double **


## numbers with different base values

> **binary:** 0b prefix
> **octa** : 0o
> **hexa:** 0x

```
print (0b10001)
print(17)
print(0o21)
print(0x11)

// All the above codes will output 17
```


## exponential representation

```
print (1.25e2)
```

> 1.25e2 is (1.25 * 10 ^ 2)
> 1.25e-2 is (1.25 * 10 ^ -2)

```
print(0xFp2)
print (0x9p2)
```

**0xNpn means ((N to dec) * 2 ^ n) **

```
 print(1_000_000)
 print(1_1000_000)
 print(1_009990_000)
```

> **numbers acn be separated by _ to increase readability**

```
 print(1_000_000.0000)

 print(1_000_000.99_0000_666)
```
 


## Type Conversions

**If value is not compatible with given type then compiler will report an error**


```
print(UInt8.max + 1)
// error: arithmetic operation '255 + 1' (on type 'UInt8') results in an overflow

let notNegative: UInt8 = -1
//  error: negative integer '-1' overflows when stored into unsigned type 'UInt8'

let int16: UInt16 = 2_000;
let int8 : UInt8 = 10;

print(int16 + int8);
print(int16 + UInt16(int8))
```
**even two numbers of different types cannot be operated together without type Conversions**

```
print(UInt8(int16))
//error: not enough bits to represent

let newInt8: Int8 = 20;

let newUInt8: UInt8 = 10;

print(newInt8 + newUInt8)

print(newInt8 + Int8(newUInt8))
```
```
print(UInt8(-20))
```
**if value is negative it cannot be converted to unsigned number**
```
print(Int8(245))
```
> not allowed because 245 will overflow

**swift is rigid when it comes to type Conversions**



## Converting Int to Float

**conversion between Int and Float must be explicit**

```
var aInt: Int = 20

var aFloat: Float = 10.33;

// print(aInt + aFloat) error

```
> but following will not be an error

```
print(3 + 3.55)
print(aInt + Int(aFloat))
//=> 30
print(Float(aInt))

print(aFloat + Float(aInt))
```
> by default, literals do not have type



##Type Aliases

**Alternative name for an existing type**
*useful when we want to give meanings to types for a particular context*

```
typealias Age = Int8;

var myAge : Age = 15;

print(myAge)
print(Age.max)
```


## Boolean


**true and false**

**automatic type conversions are not allowed**

```
var hasError = true;

if hasError {
  print("yes, it has error")
}
```

> in other languages, non zero value is treated as true and 0 as false,
> In swift it will give an error

```
let hasPassed = 1;

if hasPassed {
   print("has passed")
}
```
***Int is not convertible to Bool***

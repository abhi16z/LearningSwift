// “A function indicates that it can throw an error by including the throws keyword in its declaration.”

// if a function throws error then error is propagated out of the scope of current execution until the error is handled

// do created a new scope, insode which we can have a try block and it can then flow the error to catch block

//!~~
// do {
//   try some() throws {

//   }
// } catch {
